This is My note during testing A EXE *_^ : reference (Practical Malware Analysis)


****************************************************************************************************************************************
Typically DLL can export function to use by an executable,On the other hand, EXE is not designed to export any function
(it so rare). If you fund an EXE export a function(In Dependency walker) then you have to check.

If there is a (WSock32.dll or Ws_32.dll) in the exutable it mean (the EXE is accsessing the network or (C2C))


Pro Tips (If you run string command on EXE and few string shows ) this measn the EXE is packed or obfuscatedbut dont warry threr are some tool
can unpacked the EXE if not then run it Dynamically 


Pro Tips: If the EXE has a function Called (CreatProcessA) it basically tells us the EXE will probably create another process
(Watch out additional process when running it)


Injection Malware: The malware first needs to target a process for injection (e.g. svchost.exe). This is usually done by searching through 
processes by calling a trio of Application Program Interfaces (APIs): CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, Process32First, and Process32Next.
CreateToolhelp32Snapshot is an API used for enumerating heap or module states of a specified process or all processes, and it
returns a snapshot. Process32First retrieves information about the first process in the snapshot, and then Process32Next is
used in a loop to iterate through them. After finding the target process, the malware gets the handle of the target process
by calling OpenProcess.

The PE file header :
.text:contains instruction that CPU execute
.rdate: contains the import and export function(same Dependency walker  !) 
.idate: if present, it stored the import function. if not present you can find them in .rdata
.edate: if present, it stored export function. if not present you can find them in .rdata
.data: stored global variable 
.rsrc: stored resources used by an executable that is not considered part of it: such as logo image and strings 


Using PEview: the most intersting infomation come from the section header, which are in IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER in whcih it decripe each section
of PE file.
